    <h3>Operating Systems</h3>

    <p>
        An operating system, often abbreviated to ‘OS’, is a control program for a computer, which allocates computer resources and schedules all the various tasks that other software need to work correctly.<br><br>

        By “computer resources” we do not refer only to CPU and memory, but also to more “tangible” components such as CD/DVD-ROM drive, keyboards, mice, external hard drives, printers, and anything else that is connected to the computer through a communication port, such as USB, VGA, Serial Port, etc…<br><br>

        The CPU is scheduled by the OS in such a way as to allow each task to receive an appropriate amount of CPU’s time, thus enabling the CPU to work on just one task at a time, while giving the impression of running many programs simultaneously. Also, memory must be allocated so that only one task uses a given area of the memory at a given time.<br><br>

        A major function of an operating system is to manage the access to the hard disk drives and provide a suitable system of data retrieval through the creation and maintenance of a Disk Operating System (DOS) that manages files and directories. OS will also provide housekeeping utilities to enable the user to interact in those areas requiring a human decision.<br><br>

        Most operating systems for PCs, however, are single-user: this means that only one user at a time can get access to the computer’s resources. Contrariwise, network operating systems are, by definition, multi-user and multitasking. Also, many operating systems tend to be platform-dependent: this means that they will only run on a single range of PCs. An example could be Apple’s macOS, their proprietary operating system which runs only on their Macintosh computers. In fact, macOS cannot run on a regular Windows PC. This is mainly due to the different processors that the two types of machines can employ. But there’s a third family of operating systems, which is called UNIX, that can both run on Macintosh computers and Windows PCs. It is also used by most of the minicomputers and mainframes.

    <h3>Macintosh vs. Windows</h3>

    <p>
        Windows and Macintosh are two competing OS in use today. Both have gained popularity, but for different reasons.<br><br>

        Microsoft Windows is a software operating system developed by Microsoft that, soon after its introduction, became immensely popular among PC users, due to the introduction of a graphical user interface, which MS-DOS didn’t have. It is developed on two parallel routes: one that is intended for personal use, and the other for professional use. While the personal edition features greater multimedia support and lacked networking capabilities, the “pro” version, contrariwise, offers great networking and security features, but lacked multimedia support. Their most successful version is Windows XP, released in 2001, even though today the most popular version of the OS is Windows 10, released in 2015.<br><br>

        On the other hand, Macintosh, also known as “Mac” or “iMac” (where ‘i’ stands for ‘internet’), refers to a brand name that includes a series of personal computers developed by Apple Inc.<br>
        Apple produces its own hardware and software, so they can strictly cooperate together to give the users both performance and stability while they operate.<br><br>

        While Macs can be more stable, secure, reliable, fast, on the other hand Windows PCs are less expensive, more popular, and they are available in an unending variety of choices.

    <h3>The Graphical User Interfaces</h3>

    <p>
        In 1980, Apple Computers introduced the Apple Lisa, the first computer that included a Graphical User Interface (GUI), with an extensive use of icons and graphical controls that were manipulated via a mouse. For the time, this was a breathtaking feature. Until then, PCs were only machines that required a certain knowledge of sophisticated instructions to work, since there were not yet operating systems with a graphical interface, but on the command line. The most popular was MS-DOS, which was sold with every IBM or IBM-compatible PC.<br><br>

        With GUI OS, users employ mouse techniques such as pointing, clicking, highlighting and dragging to accomplish the majority of operating system operations.<br><br>

        The Apple Lisa was revolutionary for the personal computer market, and led to perhaps the most important breakthrough in the adoption of GUIs, the advent of the Apple Macintosh. But, due to many factors, Macintosh was not universally adopted, and the first GUI to gain an overwhelming market share was Windows 3.1, later replaced by the way more overwhelming Windows 95.<br><br>
